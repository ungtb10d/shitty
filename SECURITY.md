# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

There are no security specific releases of shitty. Security bugs are fixed
and released just like all other bugs.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Preferably send an email to kovid at ungtb10d.net or open an issue in the
GitHub repository, though the latter means you are disclosing the vulnerability
publicly before it can be fixed.
